# MarketMaestro

Challenge to create a Ticker website for the Crypto and Stock Markets for a group of 4 Frontend Developers:

Moustafa El Dahhan (Team Lead)
Esse Dirie
Constance Mitchell
Arcan Caglayan

## Objective

To create an interactive front-end project as a team fulfilling the following requirements:

- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Use at least two server-side APIs.
- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Be responsive.
- Have a polished UI.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Languages

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- The DOM
- Web APIs

## Technologies

- GitLab: To clone the repository
- GitHub: To create a new repository
- Git (MacOS Terminal): To pull and push the repository
- Visual Studio Code: To write and edit HTML and CSS
- Adobe Photoshop

## Process

1. I created my branch in the Market Maestro repository on Github using Git.

2. Team started very strong with brainstorming and decisiveness. We were able to plan together straight away.

3. Team meetings held to ensure we we all on track.

4. I pulled the files from Github after the rest of my group had finished with them, to work on UI polishing and styling through HTML and CSS.

5. I reviewed and edited descriptions in the HTML and CSS documents.

6. I worked with images provided by my team for the backgrounds first in Photoshop and then styling in CSS.

7. I came up with a style plan and color scheme and used the "root" CSS variable for the color scheme. I used Google fonts.

8. I wrote basic copy for content for the viewer to understand what the site and pages were about.

9. I added two new HTML and CSS pages as per the original plan by the team to link from the home page to each section "Stock Market" and "Crypto Market."

10. I revamped the index page to accomodate the teams original plan and link to the new HTML pages.

11. I reviewed the HTML, CSS and Javascript files to ensure the appropriate class attributes connected. As I worked that it would have good accessibility.

12. I ensured the HTML headings and elements followed a logical sequential structure and that there were no other errors, same for CSS.

13. I ran into an error and to save time with an already tight time constraint, I noted and left the errored code in HTML to ensure the APIs worked as planned.

14. I ensured everything worked without bugs and that it worked responsively. I did extensive testing and used Chrome Developer for review and to try on mobile sizes.

15. I finished this Read Me page. A Read Me exists with the teams version of the submitted project. This is my own.

16. I encountered some difficulties when trying to add my documents to my branch. I created a new repo in my Github to complete the project.

17. I pushed my completed challenge to my GitHub repository using Git.

18. I added the URLs to Bootcamp and submitted my assignment.

## Lessons Learned

I thought this would be a simple site with few page elements to style and make responsive in CSS. There was more involved than I anticipated, and I found my strong attention to aesthetic detail struggling with my new found CSS skills. In time I will be more experienced and able to save time with a better understanding CSS. I added a clear button and added it in Javascript as well.
